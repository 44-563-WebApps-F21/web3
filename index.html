    <h3>Geometry Convex hull</h3>
    <p>In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it.
        <br> The convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset of a Euclidean space, or equivalently as the set of all convex combinations of points in the subset.
        <br>They can be solved in time {\displaystyle O(n\log n)}O(n\log n) for two or three dimensional point sets, and in time matching the worst-case output complexity given by the upper bound theorem in higher dimensions.
